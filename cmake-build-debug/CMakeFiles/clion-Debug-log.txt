CMake Deprecation Warning:
  Support for "Extra Generators" like

    CodeBlocks

  is deprecated and will be removed from a future version of CMake.  IDEs may
  use the cmake-file-api(7) to view CMake-generated project build trees.


CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:9 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindMAVSDK.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "MAVSDK", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "MAVSDK" with any
  of the following names:

    MAVSDKConfig.cmake
    mavsdk-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "MAVSDK" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "MAVSDK_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "MAVSDK"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
